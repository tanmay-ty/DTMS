Dynamic Triangulation Mapping Strategy 
Instructions for running the code:
1. Clone this repository 
2. Download and install webots an open sourcce robot simulator from https://cyberbotics.com/
3. After done with intallation, run the triangulation2.wbt file from the repository and you are good to go!


Due to limitations of the software only 2 - 3 triangulation iterations can be simulated. If you are working on this project try to simulate in some other software to see if you can get better simulation results.
